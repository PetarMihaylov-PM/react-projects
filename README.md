# React Projects Repository  

Welcome to my **React Projects Repository**, where I explore different aspects of React development through various projects. Each project is designed to enhance my skills in component-based architecture, state management, API fetching, and UI rendering.  

## 🚀 Projects Included  

### 🗺️ Travel Journal  
A simple **static React app** that displays travel destinations in a clean and organized layout. This project focuses on **component-based rendering** and **props management** to structure UI elements effectively.  

### 🍽️ Bite Builder  
A **kitchen assistant app** that helps you make the most out of the ingredients you have at home! Enter your available ingredients, and an **AI-powered recipe generator** will suggest delicious meals you can cook. This project integrates **API fetching** and **dynamic state handling** for an interactive user experience.
