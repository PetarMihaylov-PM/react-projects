Welcome to my **React Projects Repository**, where I explore different aspects of React development through various projects. Each project is designed to enhance my skills in component-based architecture, state management, API fetching, and UI rendering.  

## 🚀 Projects Included  

### 🗺️ Travel Journal  
A simple **static React app** that displays travel destinations in a clean and organized layout. This project focuses on **component-based rendering** and **props management** to structure UI elements effectively.

### 🎲 Tenzies
Tenzies is a simple dice game built with React. The goal is to roll until all dice show the same number. You can click on dice to hold their value between rolls. I used React state, props, and conditional rendering to manage the game logic and UI.

### 🤔 Hang man - Dev mode
Fully interactive Hangman game created with React, focusing on clean state management and dynamic UI rendering. The game tracks user guesses, validates input, and conditionally updates the word display and keyboard layout. I used the clsx library to efficiently toggle CSS classes based on game state, and integrated Framer Motion to add smooth animations for transitions and feedback. A confetti animation triggers upon a successful game, providing satisfying visual feedback.
